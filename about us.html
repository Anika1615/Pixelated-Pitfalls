                <h3>AADYA MIMANI : FOUNDER</h3>
                <p>Hi, I’m Aadya Mimani, the founder of Pixelated Pitfalls! When I’m not immersed in building and curating content for the website, I’m probably on the badminton court, playing some tunes on my keyboard, or pushing my limits as an athlete. Pixelated Pitfalls is a space where I combine my passions for tech, creativity, and sports. I want to make sure that young people like us can use social media in a way that boosts our confidence, keeps us safe, and doesn’t take us away from our real-life connections.</p>

                <h3>ANIKA BHUTADA : CO-FOUNDER</h3>
                <p>Hi, I’m Anika Bhutada, the co-founder of Pixelated Pitfalls! When I’m not helping shape the direction of the website, you’ll likely find me buried in a good book, singing my heart out, or embracing the spotlight with my love for performance. I believe in the power of storytelling—whether it’s through music, words, or the creative content we bring to Pixelated Pitfalls. I’m excited to be part of this journey and can’t wait to share everything we’re working on with you!</p>

            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Pixelated Pitfalls started when we realized that our thumbs were getting more exercise than our legs. We were glued to our screens, scrolling through memes, watching funny videos, and trying to keep up with the latest trends. But the more we scrolled, the more we noticed how social media was messing with our heads—making us feel left out or just plain tired. We figured if it was happening to us, it was probably happening to other kids too!</p>

            <p>So, we decided to do something about it. We wanted to create a fun and friendly place where kids could learn about social media without getting bored or feeling lectured. A place where we could laugh about the silly stuff but also talk about the serious stuff, like feeling pressured to get likes or comparing ourselves to what we see online. And that’s how Pixelated Pitfalls was born!</p>

            <p>We’re just a bunch of 14-year-olds who get it—because we’re going through it too. Our mission is to help you scroll smarter, feel better, and have more fun both online and offline. Welcome to Pixelated Pitfalls, where we learn, laugh, and grow together!</p>
